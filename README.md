# PhoneBook
Written in C++ (Linux environment), this PhoneBook can store any number of personal contacts for multiple owners. The owners log in to their personal PhoneBook with the username and password of choice. The program checks if the username-password combination is correct and then proceed to open the personal PhoneBook. Owners may add, update, or delete contacts by name and number. They may also find contacts by name or number.
