# PhoneBook
Written in C++ (in Linux environment), this PhoneBook can store any number of personal contacts for multiple owners. Users may add, update, or delete contacts by name and number. They may also find contacts by name or number.

## Special Functionality
### Storing Contacts
The PhoneBook stores more than just the phone number of the contact. It can also store their email and home address (optional).

### Finding Contacts
The PhoneBook will display all names that are similar to the name being searched. 

### Updating Contacts
The PhoneBook has the ability to update existing contacts with a new name, number, email and address.

### Viewing PhoneBook
The PhoneBook can also be viewed as a table of contacts in the order they were stored.

## Future Plans

1. Displaying contacts in alphabetical order.
2. Storing multiple numbers, emails and addresses for a contact.
3. User can choose the exact contact they would like to see information for after being given search results.
